# ScriptRunner Vendors API Example

This is an example custom field plugin for Jira that demonstrates usage of
Vendors API for ScriptRunner for Jira Data Center.

The Vendors API enables other vendors to contribute to the ScriptRunner Behaviours feature. This contribution means that
Jira Admins can orchestrate a custom field on Issue Create and Edit pages. Admins can then access the current `form`
value, change that value, set the field to read-only status, and react on user input from SR Behaviours Groovy code.

This repository demonstrates how to integrate with Vendors API. Please follow
our official [documentation](https://docs.adaptavist.com/display/_PK/SR4JS/vendors-api) on how to use this repository.
